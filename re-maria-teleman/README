re-

Do you need to make a poster, a handout, or a sculpture? We both know you will not bother handmaking it... As you digitally prepare your content remember this:
your content will ultimately have to exist in the real world. With "re-" you can (hopefully) avoid the frustration of printing and modifying your project over and 
over again until you are satisfied with the result. Uploading your poster to "re-" allows you to visualize your digital content in the physical world, digitally... 
This tool makes the eventual translation from digital to physical smoother, stop stressing out and re-contextualize your content!

## Who is this for?
For now, anyone who needs to make a poster can benefit from this tool, especially if you are new to this.

## Why does this exist?
As we continue to use digital tools to create various content (such as posters, pamphlets, sculptures, and so on) we often lose sense of scale, 
becoming out of touch with the content's relation to the real world. This tool attempts to give us a more realistic perception of our work as we get 
forced out of the infinite, uniform extent of our digital artboards and model-making spaces.

## How do I use this?
Drop a file, set its size, and voila, your content now lies within a virtual room! You can change the height of the room as well as the object that lies in dialogue
with your content depending on who you are designing for. A series of animate and inanimate objects at various scales can be chosen to hopefully give you a better
idea of how your content might exist in the physical world.
